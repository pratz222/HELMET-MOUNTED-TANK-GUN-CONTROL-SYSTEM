# HELMET-MOUNTED-TANK-GUN-CONTROL-SYSTEM
Helmet-mounted tank gun control is a system that allows battle tank operators to control the movement of the main gun using head movements, rather than traditional manual controls. Proposed project aims to enhance situational awareness and improve reaction time in combat, by allowing tank operators to keep their hands free and focus on other tasks while engaging targets. The system typically involves a combination of microcontrollers, radio frequency modules, sensors and motors to move the tank-gun according to the operatorâ€™s head movements. The prototype tracks the operator's head movements to accurately aim and fire the main gun with high accuracy. It uses IMU sensors to track head movements.
